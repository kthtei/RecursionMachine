# RecursionMachine
Recursion is one of the difficult logic in CS education. 
To practice building up the OOP structure, 12 different recursion methods are created.
RecursionMachine takes input.txt text file as input and prints 12 different recursion methods.
It also takes an int which is a number of methods run and generates a random input including 
String, int and array and are randomly assigned to one of 12 methods and print out results.
